		<p class="Lora">     Analysis of the five largest US vehicle manufacturers—Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota—over the past shows drastic improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency across all consumer vehicle classes. After US legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, and vehicle manufacturers established formal guidelines to improve fuel economy in 2009, fuel economy has improved nearly 40% from 2017 to 2010 with relentless progress ahead. Furthermore, while certain manufacturers are a bit behind or ahead, no manufacturer exceeded a difference of more than 6.7% from the mean on any given year which suggests consumers can expect more efficient vehicles from all manufacturers.  </p>
