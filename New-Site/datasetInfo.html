        <p class="sectionParagraph">It’s no secret that cost surges in 2022 have created economic concerns among all citizens. When petroleum, or ‘gas’, prices have hit record highs of $5.107, it’s no surprise it’s unilaterally compared against as a measure of cost increases. And while the prices are vexing, the silver lining—both now and in the wake of the 2009 recession—is that sustainability for both the economy and environment is emphasized.
            <br><br>
            Manufacturers face pressure to produce more efficient vehicles for both economic and environmental purposes. And to complicate matters, the 2020s is the cusp of the electric vehicle revolution.
            <br><br>
            In an ideal world, everyone would switch to extremely efficient electric vehicles and intelligently charge them, however, US electrical infrastructure cannot sustain the entirety of the population switching to fully electric vehicles and neither not everyone can healthily afford the newest and most efficient vehicles.
            <br><br>
            The CAFE dataset reports average fuel economies of US manufacturer vehicles and can assist the financially responsible shopper or the curious individual in making an informed decision on an efficient vehicle.

        <hr>
        <p class="sectionParagraph">
            CAFE standards, or Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, dictate progression of annual fuel economy standards and was instated in 1975 as part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which in turn is part of the Department of Transportation.
            <br><br>
            But it was in 2009 after global warming pollution standards introduced in the Clean Air Act, that along with the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board, NHTSA’s CAFE standards gained momentum. Thus, for the sake of enacting standards, CAFE compiles provided information from US vehicle manufacturers.
            <br><br>
            Manufacturers report the average miles per gallon (MpG) of their respective classes of vehicles as fleets:
            <ul>
                <li> DP - Domestic Passenger vehicles </li>
                <li> IP - Import Passenger vehicles </li>
                <li> LT - Light Truck vehicles </li>
            </ul>
            To synthesize the data, only 5 of the 37 available manufacturers were selected: Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota. Selected for size, they represent the largest market capitalization of vehicles on US roads. If the categories are not explicitly labeled, assume data is aggregated with the average of all three vehicle categories.
