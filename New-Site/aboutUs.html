			<div class="Lora">
				<p class="firstParagraphOnThreeBar">Growing up, Sam has always been fascinated by cars. Their inner workings, the creation process, and racing, a large passion of his, are enticing and interesting to get to understand. By analyzing the CAFE dataset, he hopes that manufacturers and lawmakers can understand the importance of regulation and it's impact on the industry. He believes internal-combustion engines remain the future, but biofuel, energy systems, and regulations are critical steps to get there. </p>

				<p class="firstParagraphOnThreeBar">Jay wants to apply the scientific analysis and research skills he has learned through his four years at the Purdue School of Science in his future informatics work. The analysis of the CAFE dataset is a platform for Jay to demonstrate the multidisciplinary analytical skills he has been honing over his adult life. Lastly it also serves as a passion project while he observes the last hurrah of internal-combusion-engine-based vehicles as the general public tranisitions to electric consumer vehicles.</p>

				<p class="firstParagraphOnThreeBar">My name is Noriel Arana and I am pursuing a degree in Healthcare Engineering Technology Management or HETM for short. I am in the third year and on my way to completing my degree which would allow me to work on hospital equipment such as heart monitors and ventilators as well as many more devices. This project is very dear to me because I love gas powered cars from a performance side and see how we are changing as a society from gas to electric. </p>
