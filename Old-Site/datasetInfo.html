				<h2>Introduction to CAFE</h2>

				<div class="Lora">
					<p class="firstParagraphOnThreeBar">The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Database from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) outlines the average miles per gallon (MPG) that car manufacturers achieved each year.</p>
					<p>CAFE can be found <a href="https://one.nhtsa.gov/cafe_pic/home/ldreports/manufacturerPerformance" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p>There are 37 manufacturers represented, with some containing many separate makes (General Motors), and some choosing to separate into many different manufacturers (Dodge, Chrysler), (Fiat, Fiat Alfa Romeo), and many other nuances. For our project, we selected five of the most prominent manufacturers in the United States, which are Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nisaan, and Toyota.</p>

					<p>Each manufacturer's data is split into three different car classes.</p>
					<p>Those being:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>DP (Domestic Passenger) - Passenger cars that are produced in the United States.</li>
						<li>IP (Import Passenger) - Passenger cars that are produced in foreign countries.</li>
						<li>LT (Light Truck) - All commercially available pickup trucks, regardless of production country.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Section 2</h2>

				<div class="Lora">     
					<p class="firstParagraphOnThreeBar">Since the data began being collected in 2004, all manufacturers have increased their fuel economy by at least 10 MPG, with the exception of Toyota trucks, which grew by 9.2 mpg between 2004 and 2017.</p>
					<p>An interesting fact we noticed is the flat line at 27.5 MPG, which is our mode for all manufacturers in DP and IP cars. However, starting in 2010, fuel economy began to rise beyond that point. In 2012, the Obama Administration announced regulations that pushed for manufacturers to steadily approach 54.5 MPG. However, many federal agencies will provide bulletins that outline proposed changes and regulations, as to allow industries to respond to the news and prepare for upcoming changes. Therefore, it is believed that while the DP and IP fuel economy rose over 27.5 MPG for the first time in 2010, The Obama Administration's push in 2012 for more fuel-efficient cars sparked this movement.</p>
